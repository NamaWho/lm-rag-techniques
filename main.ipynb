Although neutralizing antibodies have been proposed as a potential key mechanism of protection against many viral pathogens, antibodies mediate additional immune functions that may have both protective and pathological consequences. Dissecting these properties against SARS-CoV-2 is likely necessary for defining metrics of immunity that will inform the design of vaccines and therapeutics and improve clinical management.\n",

In contrast with adults, children infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) develop milder clinical symptoms. Because of this, it is speculated that children vaccinated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against SARS-CoV. Antisera and T cells from mice immunised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross reactivity against SARS-CoV. The results showed no marked cross reactivity against SARS-CoV, which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by SARS-CoV may be caused by other factors.\n",

            "Document 2: Recombinant tandem epitope vaccination provides cross protection against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae challenge in mice Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleuropneumoniae/APP) is the pathogen that causes porcine contagious pleuropneumonia. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is divided into 18 serovars, and the cross protection efficacy of epitopes is debatable, which has resulted in the slow development of a vaccine. Consequently, epitope-based vaccines conferring Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cross protection have rarely been reported. In this study, B cell epitopes in the head domain of trimeric autotransporter adhesin were predicted, and 6 epitopes were selected. Then, the predicted epitopes (Ba1, Bb5, C1, PH1 and PH2) were connected by linkers to construct a recombinant tandem antigen (rta) gene. The RTA protein encoded by the recombinant rta gene was expressed, and finally the ICR mice were immunized with the RTA protein with or without inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (serovars 1 and 5b) and challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to evaluate the protective effect of the epitope-based vaccine and combined vaccine. The mice in the RTA-immunized group and RTA plus inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccine group had a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and a higher level of antibody in the serum than those in the control group. The RTA immune group had a 40% survival rate after Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection, whereas the combination of RTA and inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae produced very strong cross immune protection in mice, at least 50% (RTA IB1 + C5) and at most 100% (RTA IB5 + C1), whereas no cross immunoprotection was found in the solo Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae immune group. Overall, the combination of the RTA protein and inactivated bacteria significantly enhanced the cross protection effects. This implies that RTA protein in combination with a suitable inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain could be a candidate vaccine for porcine contagious pleuropneumonia.\n",

African Americans are more likely to be hospitalized and die from COVID-19 than other racial and ethnic groups. This is likely due to several factors, including higher rates of underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Additionally, African Americans are more likely to live in crowded and underserved communities, which can increase the risk of exposure to the virus. Finally, African Americans are more likely to have jobs that require them to work in close proximity to others, which can increase the risk of exposure to the virus.\n",
